> This research explains the implementation of machine learning algorithms such as the logistic regression model and few time series models. The binary logistic regression model is implemented to solve the binary classification problems that are problems with two class values. All the assumptions are verified after the model is built and the performance of thelogistic regression model is analyzed. Numerous time series analysis models are used to try to explain certain time series, which are often used to either understand the underlying meaning of the data points and to make predictions. The data is analyzed on different parameters to fit the best time series model. Every model is compared using different evaluation techniques and the best performing model is identified and explained. In this paper time series modelssuch as ARIMA, AUTO ARIMA, NAIVE MODEL. SEASONAL NAÏVE MODEL, ETS.

## DATA DESCRIPTION
TIME SERIES ANALYSIS
1) DATA DICTIONARY: The dataset used in this time series analysis are “The overseas trips” and “The new home registration”. “The overseas trips” prediction will be forecasted by the overseas trips by the non-residents to Ireland from the period of 2012 of quarter 1 to 2019 of quarter 4. “The overseas trips” is a quarterly time-period dataset. This dataset consists of two columns such as “year” and “Trips.Thousands”, which has 32 observations. “The new home registration” prediction will be forecasted by the registration from the year 1978 to the year 2019. “The new home registration” is an annual time- period dataset. This dataset contains only two columns namely “i.year” and “new home registration”, that has 42 rows.
- “OverseasTrips’ is a quarterly time series of overseas trips to Ireland by non-residents from Q1, 2012 to Q4, 2019.
- ‘NewHouseRegistrations’ is an annual series of new house registrations from 1978 to 2019.

LOGISTIC REGRESSION
1) DATA DICTIONARY: The file ‘Childbirths’ contains data on childbirths in a US city. The dataset provided has contains 17 columns and rows.

## OUTCOMES

- An assessment of the components of the raw time series is performed. 
- Fitted a minimum of three candidate time series models such as  simple models, exponential smoothing models and non-seasonal and/or seasonal ARIMA models.
- Performed and explained the appropriate diagnostic tests
- Forecasted each series for three periods ahead with appropriate prediction intervals and illustrated graphically and provided assessment of the adequacy of the chosen model.
